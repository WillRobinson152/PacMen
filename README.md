This was an assignment I completed for the MITxPro Full Stack Developer program. The result is a webpage with a button that create a PacMan that bounces around the browser at its own pace by using array methods and manipulating the DOM. 

You can view the webpage <a href="https://willrobinson152.github.io/PacMen/">here</a>.
